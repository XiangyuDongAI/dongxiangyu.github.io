I am an Embodied AI student researcher currently working at Northeastern University (Foshan), under the supervision of Professor Xiaoguang Ma. I received my Master's degree in Electronic Information from Zhejiang University of Technology in June 2024, with a focus on developing visual simultaneous localization and mapping (vSLAM) algorithms for ground mobile robots to achieve visual navigation in dynamic scenes.

**Markdown generator**

The repository includes [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.
