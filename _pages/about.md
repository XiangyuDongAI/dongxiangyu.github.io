I am an Embodied AI student researcher currently working at Northeastern University (Foshan), under the supervision of Professor [Xiaoguang Ma](http://www.ise.neu.edu.cn/2021/0909/c6131a202809/page.htm). Recently, I am focusing on research in Agentic UAVs. Prior to this, I received my Master's degree in Electronic Information from Zhejiang University of Technology in June 2024, where my work was dedicated to developing visual simultaneous localization and mapping (vSLAM) algorithms for ground mobile robots to achieve visual navigation in dynamic scenes.

Feel free to contact me by email if you are interested in discussing or collaborating with me.

**Research Interests**
My goal is to develop embodied navigation agents that can autonomously perceive, make decisions, and learn like humans, with applications in both aerial and ground robots. To achieve this, I primarily focus on:
1. Language-driven visual navigation (such as VLN and ObjectNav).  
2. Fine-tuning and post-training of large foundation models (such as LLMs and VLMs).  
3. LLM/VLM-powered self-evolving agents.  
4. Vision-Language-Action models and their application in embodied navigation.

**News**
- I obtained my Master's degree from Zhejiang University of Technology.
