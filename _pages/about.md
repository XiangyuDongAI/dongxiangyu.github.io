I am an Embodied AI student researcher currently working at Northeastern University (Foshan), under the supervision of Professor [Xiaoguang Ma](http://www.ise.neu.edu.cn/2021/0909/c6131a202809/page.htm). Recently, I am focusing on research in Agentic UAVs. Prior to this, I received my Master's degree in Electronic Information from Zhejiang University of Technology in June 2024, where my work was dedicated to developing visual simultaneous localization and mapping (vSLAM) algorithms for ground mobile robots to achieve visual navigation in dynamic scenes.

Feel free to contact me by email if you are interested in discussing or collaborating with me.

**Research Interests**
My goal is to develop embodied navigation agents that can autonomously perceive, make decisions, and learn like humans, with applications in drones and autonomous vehicles. To achieve this, I primarily focus on:
1. Language-driven visual navigation (such as VLN and ObjectNav).  
2. Fine-tuning and post-training of large foundation models (such as LLMs and VLMs).  
3. LLM/VLM-powered self-evolving agents.  
4. Vision-Language-Action models and their application in embodied navigation.

**News**
- I obtained my Master's degree from Zhejiang University of Technology.





**Markdown generator**

The repository includes [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.
