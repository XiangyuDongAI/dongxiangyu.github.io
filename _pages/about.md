I am an Embodied AI student researcher currently working at Northeastern University (Foshan), under the supervision of Professor [Xiaoguang Ma](http://www.ise.neu.edu.cn/2021/0909/c6131a202809/page.htm). Recently, I am focusing on research in Agentic UAVs. Prior to this, I received my Master's degree in Electronic Information from Zhejiang University of Technology in June 2024, where my work was dedicated to developing visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (vSLAM) algorithms for ground mobile robots to achieve visual navigation in dynamic scenes.

Feel free to contact me by email if you are interested in discussing or collaborating with me.

**Research Vision**

My goal is to develop embodied navigation agents capable of autonomously perceiving, making decisions, and learning like humans, and to explore their applications in aerial and ground  robots. To achieve this, I primarily focus on:
1. Language-driven visual navigation (e.g., VLN and ObjectNav).
2. Large foundation models for perception and decision-making (e.g., LLMs and VLMs) and their training techniques.
4. Lifelong / continuous / incremental learning of LLM / VLM-powered agents.
5. Vision-Language-Action models and their applications.
